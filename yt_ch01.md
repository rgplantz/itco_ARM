## Chapter 1

1.  There are several Linux commands that show you the details of the components in your computer. For example, `lscpu` will show you the details of your CPU:
``` Terminal display
$ lscpu
Architecture:             aarch64
  CPU op-mode(s):         32-bit, 64-bit

    Socket(s):            -
    Cluster(s):           1
    Stepping:             r4p1
    CPU(s) scaling MHz:   100%
    CPU max MHz:          2400.0000

    Flags:                fp asimd evtstrm aes pmull sha1 sha2 crc32 atomics fphp asimdhp cpuid asimdrdm lrcpc dcpop asimddp
Caches (sum of all):      
  L1d:                    256 KiB (4 instances)
  L1i:                    256 KiB (4 instances)
  L2:                     2 MiB (4 instances)
  L3:                     2 MiB (1 instance)
Vulnerabilities:          
  Gather data sampling:   Not affected
  Itlb multihit:          Not affected
  L1tf:                   Not affected
  Mds:                    Not affected

  Srbds:                  Not affected
  Tsx async abort:        Not affected
  $
```
Other useful commands are `free` to see memory usage and `lsusb` to see your USB devices.
Chapter 3 in Brian Ward's *How Linux Works. 2nd edition*, No Starch Press, 2015, is devoted to getting information about the devices installed in your computer.
